Course Description
------------------

Firms must develop major innovations to prosper but they often don't know how. Recent research into the innovation process has made it possible to develop "breakthroughs" systematically. This subject presents several practical concept development methods, explaining how and why each works, and the conditions under which each is effective. Presentations of real cases by invited experts conveys the "art" required to implement each.

Course Readings
---------------

All assigned readings are available from the campus copy center. A list of [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) with full citations is available online.

Assignments and Grading
-----------------------

Students' course grades will be determined primarily on the basis of the quality of two seven page papers or one 15 page paper that builds on one or more course-related topics that especially interest them. Professor von Hippel can discuss good paper topics for each student as the term progresses. In addition students are, of course, expected to prepare for classes by doing the assigned readings and participating in class discussions!
